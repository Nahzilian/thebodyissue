            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>

                Do you ever stare long and hard at your earbuds and wonder where all that wax came from? Has your throat
                made that involuntary gurgling noise in a very quiet setting, prompting you to clear your throat to try
                and cover it up? Do these scenarios prompt you to ask yourself: <em>‘Am I…gross?’</em>
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>

                Well, you might be gross, but luckily all human bodies are a little bit icky and sticky when you pay
                attention to them long enough. Rather than being embarrassed about your imperfections, Erin Ziegler, a
                nurse practitioner and assistant professor at Ryerson’s Daphne Cockwell School of Nursing, says it’s
                good to be curious about the bodily functions we don’t understand.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>

                “It is very important to know about your body, what is normal for you. Then, if something is off or
                abnormal, it’s easy for you to recognize and get help,” says Ziegler. Summed up: being curious about
                your body is how you get to know it well.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>

                Ziegler is the clinical director of a transgender primary care program, the Wise Elephant Family Health
                Team, in her work as a nurse practitioner. Her research projects focus mostly on primary healthcare for
                LGBTQ2IA+ individuals.

            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>

                Here are four questions—asked by anonymous and curious Rye students —about the bodily functions and
                processes we all experience, demystified by Ziegler herself.

                Older people seem to have a certain smell—not a bad smell, but just something characteristic of elderly
                people. What is that and why does it happen as humans age? — </strong><em>Grandma Sniffer</em>
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>

                Body odour changes as we age. Think of a newborn,they have a very characteristic smell as well.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>

                Age-related changes to body odour have nothing to do with personal hygiene, but rather odour compounds
                and bacteria on the skin. Bacteria interact with our sweat glands and as the types of bacteria on our
                skin change with age, our natural smell also changes. This is a normal part of aging.
            </p>

                <strong>Why do people have ear wax, and where does it come from?</strong> — <em>Q-Tip Queen</em>
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>

                Ear wax—or cerumen—is a waxy substance in the ear canal. Cerumen is made from secretions from the
                ceruminous and sebaceous glands inside the ear.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>

                While some people think it’s gross, it actually has a very important job. Cerumen protects the ear canal
                from infection, bacteria, fungus and water. It also helps to lubricate and clear the ear. As we age, the
                cerumen changes and can become more dry and flaky.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>

                Therefore you should never try to remove it or put things in your ear. This can cause damage or an
                impaction (build up) of wax which can lead to hearing loss or discomfort.
            </p>

                Sometimes, people get throat gurgles instead of burps that are more involuntary. Are those basically
                slow-release burps? Why do we get them?</strong> — <em>Gassy Cassie</em>
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>

                A burp is a release of excess air or gas from the stomach and is a normal bodily function. It happens
                when the sphincter in the esophagus relaxes and lets out the excess air.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>

                But not everyone can burp. For some people this sphincter can’t relax, which can cause the sensation of
                a bubble sitting at the back of their throat and that throat gurgle. This can even lead to chest pain or
                bloating and be quite uncomfortable.

                Why do some women experience so much pain with their periods? I understand that cramps happen because
                the uterus is contracting to push out blood and uterus lining, but how is it that such a routine bodily
                function can be so intensely painful for some people?</strong> — <em>PMS Princess</em>
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>

                Dysmenorrhea is a painful and severe period or menstrual cramps. There are two types of dysmenorrhea:
                primary and secondary.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>

                Primary dysmenorrhea is caused by severe contractions of the uterus and usually starts in the teenage
                years. While it’s painful, it’s not harmful and doesn’t indicate that something is wrong. This is often
                a life-long condition—some people get cramps, others don't. There are lots of medication options to
                treat this, so if this is happening speak to your primary care provider.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>

                Secondary dysmenorrhea are painful cramps that start later in life and are associated with other
                conditions like endometriosis, uterine fibroids, infection or ectopic pregnancy. For some people with
                secondary dysmenorrhea the pain is so severe they go to the emergency room. This is usually the case
                with an infection or ectopic pregnancy. For those experiencing severe pain but not seeking emergency
                medical attention, speak to your primary care provider for assessment and treatment.
