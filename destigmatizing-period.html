                Waking up on the cold tiles of a bathroom floor was an all-too-common occurrence for me as a teenager.
                When it happened, I wasn’t working through a stomach bug—I had gotten my period. And it brought me to my
                knees every single time.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                I paid attention in health class and listened to my mom, so I knew cramps were common with periods. But
                this pain was white hot, nauseating and unlike anything I had ever felt before. It happened every month
                like clockwork. I would sweat through my clothes and writhe in agonizing pain until my body finally
                succumbed to sleep. Eventually I would wake up and get ready for school. Nobody ever knew, except for my
                parents.
            </p>

            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                At some point I started missing classes, collapsing from the pain at work and my overall condition was
                getting worse with time. My family doctor said I ‘just had bad periods’ and tried to explain that what I
                was feeling was completely normal. What she didn’t know was that my mother had suffered from a chronic
                illness called endometriosis her entire life and the condition can be hereditary.
            </p>

            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                “It brought me to my knees everytime.”
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                According to the World Health Organization, endometriosis is <a
                    href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/endometriosis">“a disease where tissue
                    similar to the
                    lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus.”</a> One in 10 people with a uterus have the
                condition and it
                takes an <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/endometriosis">average of 10 years to get
                    diagnosed</a>, with <a
                    href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/endometri/conditioninfo/diagnose">the only method of
                    clinical diagnosis</a> being
                laparoscopic surgery (a keyhole surgery) and a biopsy of the endometriosis that was removed.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                In the years following, I had multiple ultrasounds, tests and physical exams. I tried numerous
                medications, started going to psychotherapy, began physical therapy, attended clinical seminars to learn
                how to manage my pain, participated in surveys and research efforts and saw a slew of specialists.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                As a result of my parent’s fierce advocacy for my health, I was ultimately diagnosed with a few
                conditions, including <a
                    href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos">polycystic
                    ovarian syndrome</a>. This is when “the ovaries produce an abnormal amount
                of male sex hormones that are usually present in women in small amounts, which can create cysts on the
                ovaries.” However, some women with the disorder don’t have cysts at all.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                I was also diagnosed with <a
                    href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136020/">vaginismus</a>, a painful condition
                where “recurrent or persistent involuntary
                spasm of the musculature of the outer third of the vagina” occurs, as well as <a
                    href="https://www.beaumont.org/conditions/pelvic-floor-dysfunction">pelvic floor dysfunction</a>,
                which occurs when there’s “either too much tension on the pelvic floor muscles or not enough,” which
                contributes to pain.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                And to the surprise of no one, I was also eventually diagnosed with endometriosis.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                All of these conditions connect and intertwine in the reproductive system, begging the question: what
                came first, the chicken or the egg?

            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                The feeling of getting diagnosed with a chronic illness is akin to drowning underwater: every sound is
                muffled, your breath is shallow and the sights around you are blurry. People are talking to you, asking
                if you’re okay, but you can’t bring yourself to reply. You’re in your own universe. It’s a space where
                the ‘before’ and the ‘after’ can co-exist, even just for a minute, before you sacrifice one for the
                other.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                I had known for quite some time that I probably had endometriosis, based on my symptoms, failed
                treatments and family history. So when I had surgery to get clinically diagnosed at 17 years old, I
                wasn’t scared or worried—I was ready.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                The reassurance was the most peaceful day of my life.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                Of course there was pain, but the overwhelming sensation of feeling validated and finally being at peace
                washed over me. I had the answers that I desperately longed for. I felt vindicated in my pain and what I
                had experienced for much of my life. For the first time, I had an explanation.

            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                Despite accepting my body after learning about my diagnosis, I didn’t talk to anyone about it. I didn’t
                tell my teachers that I had surgery, I didn’t tell most of my friends what I was diagnosed with and I
                most definitely did not talk about it on the internet. I didn’t know how to, but I also didn’t want to.
                I wanted to appear as ‘normal’ as possible, existing in a ‘normal body,’ when the truth is, my life
                isn’t normal.

            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                I have routines that the average person doesn’t have to consider, such as strict sleeping habits and
                writing in symptom journals. I take medications every day that most people can’t pronounce. I am an
                expert on medical terminology and procedures. This is my life and I got fed up with keeping these
                aspects of my existence hidden away.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                After a stream of particularly horrendous specialist appointments, I hit a new level of defeat. I was
                tired of not only feeling more sick each day that passed, but I also grew tired of not talking about it.
                My friends suggested that I start a social media diary for friends and family to witness my journey as a
                method of expression. And in December 2020, the Instagram account <a
                    href="https://www.instagram.com/her_uterus/?hl=en" target="blank">@her_uterus</a> was born.
            </p>


            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                Her Uterus is a multi-platform social media advocacy project, with the Instagram account being the main
                pillar/community resource with almost 17,000 followers. The account houses informational feed posts,
                daily updates on stories about what it’s like to live with chronic illness and humourous reels to convey
                information in an accessible way.

            </p>


            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                One of the sentiments I hear the most is ‘I wish I was as confident in talking about my illness as you
                are.’ The truth is, prior to Her Uterus, I was quite the opposite. I adhered to societal taboos and sat
                silently as these conditions took over my life. I searched high and low across the internet to find
                people like me, or a community to belong to, without much avail. When I couldn’t sleep because of the
                pain, I would watch Lara Parker’s Youtube video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ9Q7Uvi1M4"
                    target="blank">“Living With A Chronic Illness: Endometriosis”</a> and sob.
                I didn’t see people who were like me talking about being chronically ill: people in university trying to
                make it to class; people dating who were learning how to explain this to their partner; or people living
                away from home for the first time.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                So I decided to become that. It wasn’t so much about being confident or beyond stigma (although I wish I
                could claim that to be the case)—it was a lifeline for me, and I hope it can be that for someone else.
                Now I spend my days advocating for better reproductive healthcare, teaching others how to advocate for
                themselves in medical settings and breaking stigmas about periods, menstrual health and reproductive
                illness. It has been the greatest honour of my life.

                Lately I’ve been more and more ill as each month passes by. I’ve experienced levels of pain that feel
                unfathomable. I’ve had an increase in testing, scans and hospital appointments. I’m still learning how
                to manage being a student, an employee, a friend, a daughter and a sister, all while being chronically
                ill. The difference this time, though, is that I have a community standing behind me, along with a
                strong support system. It’s for this reason that I know I will make it through every day, no matter the
                pain that I feel.

            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                Being chronically ill is a full-time job that requires determination, a deep sense of belief in yourself
                and your pain, a thick skin and community to fall back on. It’s frustrating and a battle I have to win
                every day.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                There are times where I’m resentful towards my body. I don’t want to always have to be strong. But as
                time goes on I’m learning to accept that my body is fighting to keep me alive the best way it knows
                how—which is a beautiful thought.
