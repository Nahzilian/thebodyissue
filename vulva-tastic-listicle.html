                Raise your hand if you think your vulva looks ‘weird’. Now raise your hand if it doesn't look like what
                you've seen in porn. Last, but not least, raise your hand if you were ever afraid your partner would be
                turned off by your vagina while doing the deed.

            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                The vulva is the external part of the vagina, yet many people often confuse it with the entire vagina.
                While some would use both as interchangeable words, each vulva is composed of the labia, the clitoris,
                the vaginal opening and the urethral opening.

            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                Although the vulva and the vagina are a normal parts of the human body, there’s a long-standing history
                of ‘vagina shaming,’ the idea that people with vaginas should be ashamed of their genitals as it is
                perceived as ugly and unclean.

            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                A survey of 3,670 women by <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/03/226052/vagina-attitudes-survey" target="blank">Refinery29</a> found that 48 per cent of respondents had concerns about the
                appearance of their vulva. Most respondents worried about their vulva’s size, shape and colour.

                To allow you to proudly embrace the vulva for what it is, natural and normal, <em>The Eyeopener</em> rounded up

            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                Created by non-binary artist Hilde Atalanta, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the.vulva.gallery/" target="blank">The Vulva Gallery</a> (@the.vulva.gallery) aims to celebrate
                vulva diversity. At The Vulva Gallery, each illustration of a vulva is accompanied by a personal story.
                You would be surprised how each vulva looks different due to genetics, chronic disease and the
                conditions of each person’s body. All of these are completely natural and come along with having a body.
                In an effort to normalize conversations surrounding vulvas, Netflix has also teamed up with The Vulva
                Gallery to create <a href="https://www.all-vulvas-are-beautiful.com/" target="blank">All Vulvas Are Beautiful</a>, an online art gallery, which is featured in Season 3,
                Episode 3 of the comedy-drama series <em>Sex Education</em>.

            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                The Vulvette Underground (@vulvetteunderground) is a Montreal-based art project founded in 2018 by
                artists, Valérie Auclair and Gaétan Fontaine. Using vulva casting workshops, street art, photography and
                sculpture, the Vulvette Underground hopes to free the conversation around the vulva.

            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                "The vulva is the region of the body that is still the most taboo. It is an invitation to regain power
                over their image and sexuality," the duo stated on their <a href="https://vulvetteunderground.com/a-propos/" target="blank">website</a>. Photos of the sculptures can be found
                on their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vulvetteunderground/" target="blank">Instagram</a> account.

            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                The goal of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/50vulvas/" target="blank">50 Vulvas Project</a> (@50vulvas) is to normalize and de-stigmatize the appearance of
                vulvas. Creator Meg Primmer collected a total of 50 pictures of vulvas from people around the world to
                illustrate and normalize their natural diversity. In her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/COIlUoQAVRX/" target="blank">Instagram post</a>, Primmer said the concerning
                rise in labiaplasty cosmetic surgery—a surgery that decreases the size of the labia—implies that many
                feel like there is something wrong with their vulvas, and Primmer wants people to embrace their natural
                body.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                "Like all cosmetic surgery, it’s the individual's choice as to why they want to get [labiaplasty
                cosmetic surgery], but also we must question more often WHY those people feel the need to pay thousands
                to correct their genitalia, and break the stigma!" she wrote.

                Featuring gynecologist Dr. Jen Gunter, Jensplaining is a sex education show available on <a href="https://gem.cbc.ca/media/jensplaining/s01" target="blank">CBC Gem</a>. The
                show answers common questions about your body that were never discussed in your high school's sex-ed
                class. With her unique humour and expertise, Dr. Gunter guides us through misconceptions about sex and
                people assigned female at birth in our society.
            </p>
            <p class='text-font-need-to-filled-in gs_reveal'>
                Episode nine talks specifically about the vagina and calls out "wellness products" that try to profit
                off the insecurities of people with vaginas. Gunter debunks the narrative of "the dirty vagina" through
                her medical expertise and shares how to take good care of your own! Her Twitter, @DrJenGunter is also a
                hot spot for any need-to-know info about reproductive health. Very Vagical.
